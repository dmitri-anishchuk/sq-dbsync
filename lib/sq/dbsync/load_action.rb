  # An stateful action object representing the transfer of data from a source
  # table to a target. The action can be performed in full using `#call`, but
  # control can also be inverted using the `.stages` method, which allows the
  # action to be combined to run efficiently in parallel with other actions.
  #
  # This is useful because a single load taxes the source system then the target
  # system in sequence, so for maximum efficency a second load should be
  # interleaved to start taxing the source system as soon as the first finishes
  # the extract, rather than waiting for it to also finish the load. This is not
  # possible if the process is fully encapsulated as it is in `#call`.
  #
  # This is an abstract base class, see `BatchLoadAction` and
  # `IncrementalLoadAction` for example subclasses.
